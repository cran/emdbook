1.0.1: added Vonesh data, lambertW function (from bbmisc)
1.0.3: added more data (fir and fish survivorship), delta-method
       functions, get-packages function
1.0.4: added r/dzinbinom (zero-inflated negative binomial) functions
       lseq
       scinot
       added myxomatosis data
       added "none" option to curve3d
       added credible interval functions, as.mcmc.bugs

1.0.5: removed qcredint (HPDinterval[coda] is better)
       added calcslice, HPDregionplot, *chibarsq functions
       fixed deltavar
       tweaks to scinot() 
       added lump.mcmc.list()
       changed dataset names,
         moved lily and goby data sets to emdbookx
       added require(coda) to as.mcmc.bugs
       added {d,r}betabinom
       added SeedPred_mass data (numeric vector of seed masses)
       added numeric derivatives to deltavar
       fixed bug in calcslice (not referring to correct function)
       added Lily data (moved from emdbookx)

1.0.6: internal tweaks
       tiny doc fix for Myxo (sum instead of bsum)

1.0.7: tweaked dbetabinom documentation
       fixed (major) bug in get.emdbook.packages
       added aliases to data .Rd files
       added reference to gsl package in lambertW Rd file
       added gridsearch2d
       added metropSB (Metropolis-Szymura-Barton)

1.0.8: fixed major bugs in dmvnorm
       added bbmle to get.emdbook.packages
       added an extended version of trcoef (transform coefficients)
       added (preliminary) perturb.params
       tweaked some keywords/aliases
       added traditional parameterization for dbetabinom
       added note about SuppDists to ?dbetabinom
       removed coda dependency

       put myxo1.bug into BUGS directory
	

1.0.8.1: ANOTHER big bug in dmvnorm (sigh):
	spurious factor of n before log determinant
	  (should consider removing dmvnorm and
	    just referring users to mvtnorm::dmvnorm)
	added cross-ref to mvtnorm::dmvnorm in dmvnorm.Rd
